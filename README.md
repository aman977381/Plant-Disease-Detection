## Introduction

<p> In modern agriculture, plants are vulnerable to diseases due to various factors such as fertilizers, cultural practices, and environmental conditions. These diseases not only affect agricultural yield but also impact the economy reliant upon it. The ability to detect plant diseases early on can significantly aid farmers in efficiently cultivating crops, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Plant Disease Detection aims to address this critical issue by providing a solution to identify diseases in plants before they spread. Through our project, we endeavor to empower farmers with timely warnings, enabling them to take proactive measures to protect their crops and sustain agricultural productivity. </p>
